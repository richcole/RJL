Working on the scanner. Treetop turned out to be too hard to debug the gammar
so I'm back to doing a recursive decent parse because they are dead easy
to reason about.

 { a | a <=> b };

The purpose of this branch is to start with a much simpler model of
the VM with more basic instructions. This idea is then to code
control structure, exception handling, even the send instruction
as functions.

So far there are some tests and simple programs written in the VM
itself.

The next step is to work out how a code generator will access functions
such as the generic send. 

The new model requires an explicit call instruction. The earlier model
auto-invoked methods. However that turns out to be rather problematic.
