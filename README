This current experiment ended with the problem that the current interpreter
get confused about what is a message send and what is just the operand stack.

The problem came when trying to define extend:

  { sys |
    sys Object extend = { mixin |
      obj = self new;
      mixin slots each { slot |
        obj set slot (mixin get slot)
      }
      return obj;
    }
  }

Basically symbols returned from functions are evaluated becuase of the rule about
continuous evaluation of send results.

I've decided to try a new branch whose syntax is much closer to that of smalltalk.
