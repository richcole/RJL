Made a number of fixes including adding closures. Worked mostly on object
creation blocks. Currently no code generation is being done for the "(| |)"
construct, but it is being simulated via "Object new: { ... }", next
step is to make the "(| |)" work again.

I reworked processing of expression lists because they didn't work for
expressions involving a list of more than two expressions.

Next more tests around operators.

Exceptions are currently not working or tested. The top level catch
doesn't even work.

The parser doesn't error out when there are errors this should be
fixed.
