Currentl the three tests are working.

Lexical closures:
  - currently local object of a frame has a parent pointer that is set
    to the local object of the lexically closing frame
    - creating a lexical closure hasn't yet been implemented

Exceptions:
  - exceptions use a field in the frame called "catch" which is a stack
    of pc locations to jump to
  - a thin copy of the catch frame is constructed which holds the 
    new pc value
