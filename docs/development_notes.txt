Added support for exceptions.
Added support for self.
Added support Object new.
Added basic support for return

Remaining to be done:
* add a native function called println that calls the native function print
* add support for return from functions
** make return of block literals actually return the 
   function not evaluate it
* add support for inline arrays and hash tables
* add support for arrays
* add preloading of standard library



test_028.r -
  - this fails because self is not being pushed into the stack when a block is
  returned from a function call.
  - the return might be to an assignment, so really the calling code should push
  self onto the stack
  - but then there is a block check on every function return
