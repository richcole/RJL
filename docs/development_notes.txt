== Added support for a block array

- the syntax as defined doesn't allow for a neat syntax for
  updating an element of an array. Right now we have

    a = BlockArray new 10;
    a := 1 12;

  That is we're usign the := operator to do array index assignment.

- The latest test require calling initialize as part of new. This is 
  a somewhat special function because it allows the inner function access
  to the stack of the parent function.

- Also should test that subclassing an array works in that the array buffer
  will be attacked to the actual object and not inherrited from the parent.

- Presently quite a bit of the code relies on child objects having access to 
  the array elements of a parent class. This is unhealthy behaviour to have
  occur implicitly.


== Older Notes

* Added support for exceptions.
* Added support for self.
* Added support Object new.
* Added basic support for return
* Modified the way self is passed around by adding a slot to the frame
called tmp_self
* Fixed bugs related to self in throw and also in native integer
operations

Remaining to be done:
* add a native function called println that calls the native function print
* add support for return from functions
** make return of block literals actually return the 
   function not evaluate it
* add support for inline arrays and hash tables
* add support for arrays
* add preloading of standard library
