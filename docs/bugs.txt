- literal object retain the lexical parent and is_local variables. They
should not have those slots.

- block call doesn't propogate the self pointer correctly or I presume
  the lexical closure
  - test_007 is supposed to illuminate this, but block call currently takes
    a self argument and it should not, when the block is created it should 
    have it's self pointer set at that time
