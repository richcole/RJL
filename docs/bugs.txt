Code Generation
  - code generation for return statements produces no code
  - test_002 code cannot be executed
  - group expressions don't result in code except in an if statement, i.e. not when in
    an expression list

Top Level Code:
  - Executing a program causes the scanner, parse, and code generation context
    objects to be dumped.
